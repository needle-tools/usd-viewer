# Needle USD

## Usage

### Install
`npm install test-wasm-usd`

### Import
```
import getUsdModule from 'test-wasm-usd/src/emHdBindings.js';
```

### Load the Module

```
getUsdModule({
  // We need to override where the initial module is loaded from, 
  // since after bundling we can't rely on paths anymore
  mainScriptUrlOrBlob: "/emHdBindings.js",
}).then(async (Usd: any) => {
    // use Usd here
});
```

### Load a file into the virtual file system
```
const blob = await fetch("test.usdz");
const arrayBuffer = await blob.arrayBuffer();
// Create a file in the virtual file system
Usd.FS_createDataFile("", "test.usdz", new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer), true, true, true);
```

### Load file into USD

```
let driver = new Usd.HdWebSyncDriver(delegate, "test.usdz");
if (driver instanceof Promise) driver = await driver;

// This kicks off asynchronous tasks to look at everything that has changed – _SyncAll –
// which will then call into the delegate to create and update the scene graph.
driver.Draw();
```
