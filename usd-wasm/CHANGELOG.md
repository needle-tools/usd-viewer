## [1.0.0-next.0] - 2026-06-25
- Modernized the wasm runtime to upstream OpenUSD 26.05 with Hydra imaging enabled for the three.js render delegate.
- Added the Adobe glTF file-format plugin, MaterialX support through Hydra material documents, and OpenSubdiv-enabled builds.
- Added generated TypeScript declarations and usdview-style inspection/change APIs for programmatic stage interaction.
- Switched the client MaterialX shader path to `@needle-tools/materialx@1.7.0`.
- Added explicit package entrypoints for `@needle-tools/usd/three`, `@needle-tools/usd/plugins`, and `@needle-tools/usd/vite`.
- Added a Needle Engine browser matrix that validates the USD package through Engine `dist` and package-module runtime shapes.
- Added a technical demo render-host switch for viewing the same USD samples through plain three.js or a Needle Engine `Context`.
- Read stage metadata from the live `UsdStage` API so up-axis state remains stable across referenced asset reloads.
- Changed the license to PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.
